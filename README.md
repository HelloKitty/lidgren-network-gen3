Lidgren.Network is a networking library for .net framework which uses a single udp socket to deliver a simple API for connecting a client to a server, reading and sending messages.

# Unity Port

Lidgren has recently begun porting Lidgren to Unity3D. This made my repo redundant and out-of-date. I've recently reforked and prepared the solution for Unity compilation. This will be available on Nuget as LidgrenUnity and I'll maintain it better than I had previously.
